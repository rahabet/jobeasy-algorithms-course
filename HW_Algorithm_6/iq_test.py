# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which
# one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs
# from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the
# given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the
# elements start from 1 (not 0)

# ex:  iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 # Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
# iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 # Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

# def iq_test(numbers):
#     indexEven = 0
#     indexOdd = 0
#     numEven = 0
#     numOdd = 0
#     nums = numbers.split(" ")
#     for i in range(len(nums)):
#         if int(nums[i])%2 == 0:
#             numEven += 1
#             indexEven = i+1
#         else:
#             numOdd += 1
#             indexOdd = i+1
#     if numEven == 1:
#         return indexEven
#     else:
#         return indexOdd
